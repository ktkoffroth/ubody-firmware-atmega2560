# ubody-firmware-atmega2560

This piece of firmware is to be used in developing the UGA Robotics U-BODY dynamixel board. We have decided to prototype with an arduino ATMega2560 board in order to utilize it's bootloader for quicker development. We do plan on avoiding the use of any Arduino library code to improve portability and, in some cases, performance.
